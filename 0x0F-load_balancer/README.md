Description.
The folder concerns all tasks on load balancing.
Task 0:
Recreating a second server to be similar to the first server
Since weâ€™re placing our web servers behind a load balancer for this project, we want to add a custom Nginx response header. The goal here is to be able to track which web server is answering our HTTP requests, to understand and track the way a load balancer works. More in the coming tasks.

Requirements:

Configure Nginx so that its HTTP response contains a custom header (on web-01 and web-02)
The name of the custom HTTP header must be X-Served-By
The value of the custom HTTP header must be the hostname of the server Nginx is running on
Write 0-custom_http_response_header so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task
Ignore SC2154 for shellcheck

Task 1:
Involves installing and configuring HAproxy on the load balancer server.
Requirements:

Configure HAproxy so that it send traffic to web-01 and web-02
Distribute requests using a roundrobin algorithm
Make sure that HAproxy can be managed via an init script
Make sure that your servers are configured with the right hostnames: [STUDENT_ID]-web-01 and [STUDENT_ID]-web-02. If not, follow this tutorial.
For your answer file, write a Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements

Task 2:
Involves the automation of creating a custom HTTP header response with puppet. 
The name of the custom HTTP header must be X-Served-By
The value of the custom HTTP header must be the hostname of the server Nginx is running on
Write 2-puppet_custom_http_response_header.pp so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task
